            <p>Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh)</p>
            <p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)</p>
            <p>Ayy, ayy</p>
            <p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</p>
            <p>Needless to say, I keep her in check</p>
            <p>She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)</p>
            <p>Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)</p>
            <p>Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)</p>
            <p>Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check</p>
            <p>She was all bad-bad, nevertheless</p>
            <p>Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck</p>
            <p>Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck</p>
            <p>Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip</p>
            <p>Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip</p>
            <p>Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt</p>
            <p>Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt</p>
            <p>Ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
            <p>Some things you just can't refuse</p>
            <p>She wanna ride me like a cruise</p>
            <p>And I'm not tryna lose</p>
            <p>Then you're left in the dust</p>
            <p>Unless I stuck by ya</p>
            <p>You're the sunflower</p>
            <p>I think your love would be too much</p>
            <p>Or you'll be left in the dust</p>
            <p>Unless I stuck by ya</p>
            <p>You're the sunflower</p>
            <p>You're the sunflower</p>
            <p>Every time I'm leavin' on you (ooh)</p>
            <p>You don't make it easy, no (no, no)</p>
            <p>Wish I could be there for you</p>
            <p>Give me a reason to, oh (oh)</p>
            <p>Every time I'm walkin' out</p>
            <p>I can hear you tellin' me to turn around</p>
            <p>Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down</p>
            <p>Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)</p>
            <p>I know you're scared of the unknown ('known)</p>
            <p>You don't wanna be alone (alone)</p>
            <p>I know I always come and go (and go)</p>
            <p>But it's out of my control</p>
            <p>And you'll be left in the dust</p>
            <p>Unless I stuck by ya</p>
            <p>You're the sunflower</p>
            <p>I think your love would be too much</p>
            <p>Or you'll be left in the dust</p>
            <p>Unless I stuck by ya</p>
            <p>You're the sunflower</p>
            <p>You're the sunflower (yeah)</p>
